                    Welcome to whoever may be visiting my page! My name is Jacob Johnson, a student on the path to majoring in computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A little about myself to get started. I took an interest in coding since I was young so I took an AP computer science class in 12th grade. I suprised myself with how poor I did in that class because I felt like I knew quite a bit already. That was my first "taste" of coding. I took a 2-year gap after high school to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Bounced between two jobs in that timespan, and was really trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Long story short, I figured that if I already loved coding and had still been doing it in my time off of school, why not go back and get a degree in it? And that's exactly what I've been trying to do!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this page, I'm documenting my journey as well as sharing projects and accomplishments. Whether you're a fellow CS enthusiast, my amazing teachers, or just curious about my work, I'm glad you're here.
