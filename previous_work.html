                <h2>Westside Tire</h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first job out of highschool. It was a position to be a tire delivery driver and do exactly what delivery drivers do. Deliver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started working there in October 2022, and I really enjoyed it for the first bit I was there. I got to create my own routes, load my own truck, work on my own schedule in a sense. It was cool to have that sort of freedom for the first time. It was a full time job and some days were very busy, but for the most part I could get my days done in 5-6 hours even if I had to drive to places like Owatana. I would try to take longer but I always ended up being down way earlier than I could've been making.
                </p>
                <p>
                     In the end though, I realized that I didn't want to work alone for my whole life, atleast not as a driver. And I also crashed a few times in the 3-months I was there so I figured it was time for a change. And so in December I put in my 2-week and was out of there.

                    This has been my favorite job so far. It is based out in Monticello, and my friends dad is actually the owner of it. It is a manufacturing company that specializes in very small and precise cutting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, with me having no experience or schooling for machining, I could only get hired on as a "Production Operator." Which was basically me being whereever the managers needed me. Maybe one day I help out with machines or moving materials through the production line, and the next day I'm washing or deburring the pieces that are on their way out. Almost the entire 8-months I was there for, they only had me in wash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was actually quite disappointed in that because I was excited to learn how the machines worked. They also had a program that they talked to me about that would put me through schooling for free to be a machinist, and I'd still work there and get a job as a machinist full-time after I graduate. But I never got the chance to get a feel for the machines so it never struck me as something I might want to do for my life.

                    I got to the point that I really wanted to find my passion and calling before I got any older. I knew I loved computers and programming, but it was scary pursuing that because of the stories I've heard about how hard it is to find work or even jobs that'll hire new graduates. But eventually, I decided that is what I love and now I am here today.
